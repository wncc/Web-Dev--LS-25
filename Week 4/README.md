# WEEK 4 — Databases, Deployment & Final Project

Hey Coders! ✨

You’ve come a long way — from learning HTML/CSS to building full-fledged React apps and Django backends. Now it’s time to **tie it all together** with:

- **Databases** (how to store & manage data): : Understand how SQL & NoSQL databases work, why we use them, and how to use **PostgreSQL** with Django
- **Deployment** (how to get your project online!): Explore options like Render, Railway, or Vercel for getting your full-stack app live
- **Docker and how to Dockerise Django**
- **Final Project** (the most important submission — **don’t skip!**): This is your **main deliverable** for Full Stack Pro and carries **major weight** — **submitting this is mandatory**

> If you didn’t get time to complete Week 3 Django resources — **this is your chance to catch up!** Week 4 is designed to be flexible and focused on wrapping things up.

## Learning Resources

Go thorugh the resources for this week:

1. [`Introduction to Databases`](./Introduction%20to%20Databases.md) — Explains what databases are, SQL vs NoSQL, PostgreSQL basics
2. [`More about Postgre SQL`](./PostgreSQL.md) — How to use it and connect it with Django
3. [`Deployment Guide`](./Deployment%20Guide.md) — How to deploy your Django app, video tutorials

- Deployment (using any platform like Render, Railway, etc.)

You must submit:

- GitHub repo (with clean, structured code and `README.md`)
- A video demo (hosted on Drive/YouTube — make sure it’s viewable)
