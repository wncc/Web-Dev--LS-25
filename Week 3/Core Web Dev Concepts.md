# Web Development Basics

Understanding how the web works is crucial before jumping into any framework.
> For a quick refresher on the key concepts and languages you'll encounter in web development, check out this [**overview**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-development/).


## Core Concepts:

- [**HTTP protocol**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html/what-is-http/) — requests, responses, status codes, headers
- [**Web servers**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js/web-server-and-its-type/) — how they serve content (e.g., Nginx, Apache)
- [**Client-side vs Server-side**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/websites-apps/server-side-client-side-programming/)
- [**Basic frontend-backend communication**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/how-to-connect-front-end-and-backend/) (Just brush through the concepts and no need to go in depth here or optionally for a more intuitive understanding without the code parts, you can read [**this**](https://websitehurdles.com/how-to-connect-frontend-and-backend/))

> This knowledge helps you build dynamic web pages and understand frontend-backend integration.

## Core Frameworks for Python Web Development

When you’re ready to start building real web applications, frameworks like these make it easier and faster to ship production-grade apps.

### Popular Python Frameworks:

| Framework | Use Case | Highlights |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Flask** | Lightweight apps, REST APIs | Minimal, easy to learn, highly extensible |
| **Django** | Full-stack web apps | Comes with admin panel, ORM, authentication |
| **FastAPI** | APIs & performance-critical apps | Async support, auto-generated docs, very fast |

## Tools You’ll Encounter

- **SQLite/PostgreSQL/MongoDB**: Databases commonly used in Python apps
- **Virtualenv** or **Pipenv**: Managing Python environments
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and collaboration

## Checklist

In this week and the next, you’ll be introduced Django as part of the backend section. Make sure you're clear with:

- Python syntax and OOP
- Web fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Basic terminal and Git usage

> Start brushing up now so you're ready for the backend journey! Try the assignment or the practice questions to learn while doing.
