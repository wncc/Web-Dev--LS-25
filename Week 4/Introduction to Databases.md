# WEEK 4 — Introduction to Databases for Back-End Development

Hey Coders!

You’ve built your frontend, explored backend with Django, and now it's time to understand the engine that drives all your app's data — **Databases**.

Many of you might find databases a bit intimidating at first, but don’t worry — we’re here to break it down into simple, practical steps!

---

## What Is a Database?
A **database** is a structured collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It's the permanent memory of your application, storing everything from user credentials to uploaded videos.

In back-end development, databases provide **data persistence**, **security**, and **efficient querying** — all of which are critical for any real-world application.

## Types of Databases
There are two main categories:

### 1. **Relational Databases (SQL)**
- Store data in tables (rows and columns)
- Use **Structured Query Language (SQL)**
- Follow a **fixed schema**
- Best for structured data and strong data integrity
- **Examples**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite

### 2. **Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)**
- Store data in flexible formats (documents, key-value, graphs, etc.)
- Schema-less or dynamic schema
- Ideal for fast development, unstructured data, or massive scale
- **Examples**: MongoDB, Redis, Firebase, Cassandra

## Core Concepts
- **Tables and Schemas**: In relational databases, tables hold data in rows and columns. A schema defines the structure — like what fields exist, their data types, and any constraints.
- **Primary & Foreign Keys**: A primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table. Foreign keys create links between tables, helping maintain relationships and ensure data integrity.
- **CRUD**: These are the 4 main database operations — Create (add data), Read (fetch data), Update (modify data), and Delete (remove data).
- **Indexes**: Special lookup tables the database uses to speed up data retrieval. Without indexes, searching large tables can be slow.
- **Transactions**: Group a set of operations into one unit that either fully succeeds or fully fails. Essential for maintaining consistency (especially for money transfers, orders, etc.).

## Tools & Technologies
- **DBMS**: Database Management Systems like PostgreSQL (open-source SQL DB), MySQL (widely-used SQL DB), and MongoDB (NoSQL document store).
- **ORMs**: Tools like Django ORM, SQLAlchemy (Python), and Sequelize (Node.js) let you write Python/JS code instead of SQL queries, simplifying DB interaction. An ORM, or Object-Relational Mapper, is a tool that allows you to interact with your database using the same language you're coding in — like Python — instead of writing raw SQL queries. Here's what it does:
    - Converts Python classes ↔ database tables
    - Lets you use Python methods to create, read, update, and delete database entries (instead of SQL queries like SELECT * FROM users WHERE ...)
    - Makes your code cleaner, safer, and easier to maintain
Example (using Django ORM):
```
# Traditional SQL
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;

# Django ORM
User.objects.get(id=1)
```
Why use ORMs?
    - Write less and cleaner code
    - Avoid SQL injection automatically
    - Helps with migrations and schema changes
    - Easier debugging and testing
- **Admin Interfaces**: Visual tools to inspect, modify, and manage your databases — e.g. pgAdmin (PostgreSQL), phpMyAdmin (MySQL), MongoDB Compass (MongoDB).

## Intro to PostgreSQL
**PostgreSQL** is one of the most powerful and widely used **open-source SQL databases**. 

- Known for reliability, performance, and standards compliance
- Excellent with Django’s ORM
- Great community and documentation

**Why use PostgreSQL?**
- Strong data consistency and ACID compliance
- Advanced indexing and full-text search
- Extensible — supports custom data types and functions

## Backend Architecture — How Databases Fit In
A backend isn’t just code — it’s a structure made up of multiple working parts:

- **Server**: Handles incoming client requests and runs your backend logic (e.g. login, data processing)
- **App Framework**: The foundation of your backend app — e.g. Django (Python), Express (Node.js), Flask, etc.
- **Database**: e.g. user info, video uploads, comments
- **API Layer**: Interfaces (like REST APIs) that let the frontend talk to the backend by sending/receiving data
- **Middleware**: Acts as filters before/after the main backend logic — handles things like user authentication, rate-limiting, and logging

Common backend architectures:
- **Monolithic** Everything (auth, DB logic, APIs) is bundled together in one big app. Easier to start, harder to scale.
- **Microservices** Each part (user auth, video service, payments) is its own separate service. Better scalability, but adds complexity.
- **Event-driven** Systems react to events (e.g. "new user registered") using message queues or pub/sub systems. Great for async workflows.

## Why You NEED a Backend Database
- Store & retrieve persistent data
- Power features like login, comments, uploads
- Maintain consistency and handle scale
- Secure and manage critical user info

## Beginner’s Roadmap to Databases
1. Learn basic SQL commands (SELECT, INSERT, etc.)
2. Set up PostgreSQL locally
3. Understand schema and relationships
4. Try CRUD using Django ORM
5. Explore NoSQL (e.g. MongoDB) for comparison
6. Learn migrations and indexing

---

## Best Practices
- Normalize data (avoid duplication)
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Backup data regularly
- Use indexes wisely
- Secure data with roles & encrypted connections
