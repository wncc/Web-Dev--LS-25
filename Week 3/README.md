# WEEK 3 — Backend Begins!

Hey everyone! 
Hope you're all doing great and excited to begin **Week 3** of *Full Stack Pro: Frontend to Backend* by **WnCC**.

This week, we’re entering the **Backend world** — where your apps become truly dynamic and powerful!

> Hey guys.. We know backend might feel heavy or intimidating at first ..it was to us too initially and to be honest that’s okay!
>
>You don’t have to learn everything at once. Break it into smaller concepts, implement each one step-by-step, and combine them gradually.
>
>If you’re unable to complete everything this week, don’t worry — Week 4 is also focused on backend + integration. We’ve intentionally kept Week 4 light so you have time to catch up and finish smoothly.

## What’s in Store This Week?

### Python Basics
If you're new to Python or want a refresher, make sure to go through the [**Python Basics**](./Basics%20of%20Python.md) section in the content. It covers everything you’ll need to comfortably get started with backend frameworks.

> You can also brush through the core web dev concepts [**here**](./Core%20Web%20Dev%20Concepts.md)

### Why Backend?
Frontend lets users *see and interact*, but backend brings apps to life — **handling data, logic, authentication, aand more.**  
You'll be introduced to backend this week. But before that let's delve into why it's important [**here**](./Why%20Backend.md).

### Django: The Main Framework
We’ll be using Django, a powerful Python web framework, to build the backend. Go through [**this**](./Django%20Overview.md) doument to make yourselves comfortable with django.

### Assignment

The [**Week 3 Assignment**](./Assignment.md) is now live and focuses entirely on **backend concepts** — like handling data.

> This is a **crucial part** of your final project. In Week 4, you’ll combine this backend with your frontend to create a full-stack app.
