## What is Deployment?

**Deployment** refers to the process of taking your Django project (running locally) and making it publicly accessible on the internet. Once deployed, users can access your web application through a browser from anywhere.

## Notes

- Platforms like **Render** and **Railway** allow for full-stack Django deployment, including PostgreSQL database.
- **PythonAnywhere** is ideal for educational or small-scale apps using SQLite.
- **Vercel** and **Netlify** are suited for frontend hosting (React, Vue, etc.), with Django REST APIs running on separate backends (e.g., hosted via Render or Railway).
- Always configure your environment variables, database settings, and media/static file handling properly before deploying.
